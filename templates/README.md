# Templates

## Here are a few things standard between templates that you should do for program files:

- The header at the top - you should change this to your name and the date, not that it should always be in the date format YYYY-MM-DD
- Typing - please use typing in function definitions where applicable to make everyone's life easier, for example, `def test(text: str):`
